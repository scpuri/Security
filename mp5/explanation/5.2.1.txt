At bootup, its clear that the OS system booted up was Puppylinux. The release number was found by googling ‘pup-431’ to learn that the release number is just 4.31.

The dangerous behavior is some sort of data corruption, but looking at the pupsave.2fs file, it was tampered with to print a message and set the dd input to null.

The primary OS was found in the other drive through the boot section and again by googling it was easy to find the suspect was using Ubuntu 15.10
