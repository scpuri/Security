From using known_hosts.txt in the /ssh related directories, the method used was ecdsa-sha2-nistp256. So on the victim’s side the public and private key would be the files ssh_host_ecdsa_key and ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub, which can be found on the victim’s computer in /ssh directory as well. 

By looking at the .bash_history on suspects directory, we can see the tools used by the suspect to pass the document over ssh to the victim. 

The password used to access the victim’s computer was the value stored in the encrypted zip file on the suspect’s computer.
